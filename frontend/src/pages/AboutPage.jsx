          <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 mt-6">
            ReelFriend isnâ€™t a black box. Think of it like this, if a close friend recommended a movie to you, 
            they might explain why theyre recommending it. So, it's like they're giving you a personal explanation behind their choice, 
            not just saying, "I think you'd like this."
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 mt-4">
            Just like that friend, ReelFriend provides insights into your recommendations. The more 
            you interact, the more personalized the recommendations become.
