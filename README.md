## ReelFriend

This personal project presents a neural hybrid recommendation model that combines matrix factorization with deep learning, enhanced by residual connections and custom feature engineering. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and JavaScript, the model addresses key challenges like data sparsity and cold starts.

To boost transparency, SHAP-based post hoc explanations are integrated, giving users insight into why items are recommended. Trained on the MovieLens ml-latest-small dataset, the model achieves 20% higher accuracy across key metrics compared to standard baselines!

The system is integrated in a companion web app, ReelFriend, which delivers personalized, explainable recommendations in a real-world interface.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before developing the recommendation model, an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on the MovieLens dataset to understand the dataâ€™s structure and patterns. The exploratory data analysis was performed in a dedicated Python script, `exploration.py`, using the `matplotlib` and `pandas` libraries. The script loads the MovieLens dataset, applies data transformations, computes summary statistics, and generates figures for various statistics. The use of `matplotlib` enabled quick generation of these figures, which were helpful in gaining a better grasp of the dataset.

## Evaluation
![Model Evaluation Results](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceb3f993-8337-4f17-83e2-30120b4b0319)




The results highlight the strengths of the hybrid deep learning neural model, which achieved the lowest **RMSE** and **MAE** values among all evaluated approaches. This indicates a stronger ability to accurately predict user ratings.

These results show a ~20% accuracy improvement over baseline models! Meaning my model is very good at predicting what users will like on average.

In contrast, traditional collaborative filtering methods, both user-based and item-based, show higher prediction errors, likely due to their limited ability to model complex relationships in the data.
